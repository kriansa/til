# Micro-leadership
> Or how to lead when you're not the leader.

A few days ago this was a topic that caught my attention. Particularly because of an article posted on Huffington Post.

Basically, the main idea (that's not even that young) is based on the fact that each one of us can be a leader, and it's not something 'granted' by a person based on its title or position.

In my business school classes, it is widely spread the idea that the boss is not always the leader - indeed, often they aren't.

The micro-leadership concept is given upon the fact that, leadership is not a single act, but a continuous mindset of actions with the main objective to serve others. It's decoupled from formal positions and it's based on small but meaningful acts of servant, every day.

There are some principles that may help us building this leadership framework.

1. __Seek responsibility__

  This one has to do with being more aware of different parts of the company. Getting familiar with the areas that are affected by your work will also help you to understand how each piece from the organization will fit together.

  Also, it's about taking responsibility for your actions. Even if you've made a mistake, stand up and face it, learn with it and move on. Stop whining thinking the world is conspiring against you.

2. __Be a mentor and coach to others__

  If you have the opportunity to work with people who are new to the organization, take time to get them to know how the things work, and be available to them when they have questions.

  Not only for newcomers, but people you work with everyday. Share your knowledges with them as well. The idea is not to be an asshole. Many people like to see each other as a competitor and refuse to help them.

3. __Exceed the expectations that are set for you__

  This could be easily translated as: "under promise and over deliver". A leader is a inspiring person, and being a over deliver is a awesome value to be followed.

I took the liberty to copy some practical actions about how does micro-leadership look like. Here are a few examples:

- It's asking a reticent teammate for their opinion when they have been quiet the whole meeting.
- It's responding with kindness when someone greets you with anger or fear.
- It's accepting responsibility even when it wasn't your fault.
- It's sharing praise that was directed at you, with your teammates.
- It's being willing to say no when everyone else is saying yes, and being willing to say yes when everyone else is saying no.
- It's taking the time to thoughtfully share constructive feedback.
- It's asking the questions no one else will ask.
- It's arriving early to help set up, and staying late to help clean up.
- A world filled with acts of micro-leadership is one where it's possible for everyone to be a leader even without being the leader. It's one where rather than the exceptional few, leaders are the exceptional many.

It's always something we can always do. It's time to stop waiting on someone else's and be a leader every day.
